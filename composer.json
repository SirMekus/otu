    "description": "Otu is a PHP-based package that handles fine-formatting of string representation of (very) large numbers with their 'magnitude'. For instance, '50m' means 50000000. We can decide to write the entire 50000000 or just pass it to this package in the form of '50m' and have it take care of the presentation. It also works vice-versa. Walk with me.",
